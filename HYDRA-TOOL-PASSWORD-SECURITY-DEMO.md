## Introduction to HYDRA
HYDRA is a powerful tool for network logon cracking. It supports many different protocols and has a flexible architecture that allows for extended functionality.

## Password Security Best Practices
1. **Use Strong Passwords**: Passwords should be long and complex, incorporating letters, numbers, and symbols.
2. **Regularly Update Passwords**: Change passwords periodically to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
3. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**: Adding an extra layer of security can help mitigate password-related vulnerabilities.

## Demonstration of Password Cracking
In this section, we will demonstrate how HYDRA can be used to test password strength through network login attempts. This is for educational purposes to understand vulnerabilities.
